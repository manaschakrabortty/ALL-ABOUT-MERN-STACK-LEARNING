My MERN Stack Journey ðŸš€

Welcome to my MERN Stack journey! ðŸŽ‰ In this repository, I will be sharing my experiences, learning progress, and the projects I build using the MERN stack. For those who are new to it,


MERN stands for:

	MongoDB - A NoSQL database
	Express.js - A web application framework for Node.js
	React.js - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
	Node.js - A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine



Introduction
The MERN stack is one of the most popular stacks for developing modern web applications. Combining MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js, it offers a full-stack development environment using just JavaScript, both on the client and server sides.

My goal is to understand each component in depth and apply it to build robust, scalable web applications. This journey will cover everything from the basics to advanced concepts like authentication, REST APIs, and deploying applications.
