# LeetCode Clone - Full Stack Project


Welcome to my LeetCode Clone project! This repository is dedicated to building a platform similar to LeetCode, Name -meetcode, an online platform for algorithmic problem solving, using a full-stack approach. The goal is to understand how a platform like LeetCode works under the hood and apply that knowledge to create a fully functional clone.

Project Overview
        LeetCode Clone aims to replicate the key features of LeetCode, such as problem-solving, creating an account, and tracking progress. In this project, we will cover the full-stack development process, from setting up the backend to integrating the frontend for a seamless user experience.


Install dependencies:
        Frontend: cd frontend && npm install
        Backend: cd backend && npm install
        Run the app:
        Frontend: npm start
        Backend: npm run dev
